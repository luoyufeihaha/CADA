# Class-Aware Adversarial Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Linguistic Steganalysis

This repository contains the implementation of the Class-Aware Adversarial Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (CADA) method for linguistic steganalysis as described in the paper "Class-Aware Adversarial Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Linguistic Steganalysis" by Zhen Yang, Yufei Luo, Jinshuai Yang, Xin Xu, Ru Zhang, Yongfeng Huang.

## Overview

[Provide a brief overview of the CADA method and its significance in the field of linguistic steganalysis.]

## Key Features

- Class-Aware Adversarial Pre-Training (CAPT) for domain-invariant feature extraction.
- Weighted Class-Aware Domain Distance (WCADD) for aligning domain distributions.
- Class-Aware Label Smoothing (CALS) for soft label training.
- Class-Aware Fine-Tuning (CFT) with Class-Aware Progressive Strategy (CAPS) for target domain adaptation.
